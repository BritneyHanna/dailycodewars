// Given a string of words, you need to find the highest scoring word.

// Each letter of a word scores points according to its position in the alphabet: a = 1, b = 2, c = 3 etc.

// You need to return the highest scoring word as a string.

// If two words score the same, return the word that appears earliest in the original string.

// All letters will be lowercase and all inputs will be valid.

// Best practice solution

// You can print your name on a billboard ad. Find out how much it will cost you. Each letter has a default price of £30, but that can be different if you are given 2 parameters instead of 1.

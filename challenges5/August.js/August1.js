// You have an award-winning garden and every day the plants need exactly 40mm of water. You created a great piece of JavaScript to calculate the amount of water your plants will need when you have taken into consideration the amount of rain water that is forecast for the day. Your jealous neighbour hacked your computer and filled your code with bugs.

// Your task is to debug the code before your plants die!

function rainAmount(mm) {
  if (mm < 40) {
    return `You need to give your plant ${40 - mm}mm of water`;
  } else {
    return "Your plant has had more than enough water for today!";
  }

// Bob drinks too much, and he gets in trouble for it a lot. He drinks so much, in fact, that he has broken the local law enforcement's breathalizer with his alcoholic breath! Bob feels simply aweful, so he wants to make up for it by creating a function that will calculate his blood-alcohol level for them. Unfortunately, Bob has gotten too inebriated to do any programming today, so he needs your help!

// He did manage to research the formula for blood-alcohol content before getting too drunk, which he describes below.

// BAC calculator Formula:

// BAC% = (A × 5.14 / W × r) - .015 × H

// A: Total alcohol consumed, in ounces (oz)
// W: Body weight, in pounds (lbs)
// r: The alcohol distribution ratio, 0.73 for man, and 0.66 for women
// H: Time passed since drinking, in hours

function bloodAlcoholContent(drinks, weight, sex, time) {
  let r;
  sex === "male" ? (r = 0.73) : (r = 0.66);
  let bac = ((drinks.ounces * drinks.abv * 5.14) / weight) * r - 0.015 * time;
  return Number(bac.toFixed(4));
}

// In javascript, Number is one of basic data types. It can be positive: 1,2,3, negative:-1,-100 , integer:123,456, decimal:3.1415926,-8.88 etc..

// Numbers can use operators such as + - * / %

// Task
// I've written five function equal1,equal2,equal3,equal4,equal5, defines six global variables v1 v2 v3 v4 v5 v6, every function has two local variables a,b, please set the appropriate value for the two variables(select from v1--v6), making these function return value equal to 100. the function equal1 is completed, please refer to this example to complete the following functions.

// When you have finished the work, click "Run Tests" to see if your code is working properly.

// In the end, click "Submit" to submit your code pass this kata.

//Welcome. In this kata, you are asked to square every digit of a number and concatenate them.

// For example, if we run 9119 through the function, 811181 will come out, because 92 is 81 and 12 is 1.

// Note: The function accepts an integer and returns an integer
